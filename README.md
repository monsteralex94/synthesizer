# synthesizer
a little synthesizer

this program is a synthesizer that gets a midi file and a preset file as input and outputs a wav file that plays the midi with the preset. it has:

- master volume
- volume envelope
- basic waveforms (sine square saw)
- 3 oscilators
- separate volume for oscilators
- transpose for oscilators
- detune feature (voices, amount, phase randomization)

i might do a lv2 version some day
